# react-todo
First react project

Learnt: 
-adding js to html element
-onchange runs multiple functions
-set type to button else automatically sets all button types to submit
-react.strictmode renders twice as a feature, see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58603209/react-hooks-render-twice
-linear-gradient did not stretch to the bottom of the page due to body issues so added solution from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34108433/html-css-linear-gradient-not-taking-up-full-screen
